# Simple AR Image Tracking

This is an example Project to showcase how Image Tracking with AR Foundation works in Unity. In order to change the *Tracking Targets* you have to change the *Image References* in the *Tracking Library*. Please adjust the physical size of the Images in the Tracking Library if needed. The Image References in the original PDF are 3cm x 3cm each.
